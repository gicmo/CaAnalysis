Analysis scripts for Ca²⁺ Imaging
===============================

Various Python scripts for the analysis of calcium imaging data in single neurons. For example, these scripts were used to obtain the ΔF/F of calcium imaging signals averaged over the length of the dendrite of a single neuron. These scripts can work with files generated by the [Ca²⁺ Manager][manager] ImageJ plugin.
